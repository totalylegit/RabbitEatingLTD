        <h2>About Us</h2>
        <p>Carrot Café, a Rabbit Eating LTD venture, is a student-powered food service that provides fresh, affordable, and sustainable meals straight to campus. Designed with the university lifestyle in mind, we offer a monthly subscription with weekly customizable meal plans developed by student dietitians and prepared by culinary students. Our menu includes healthy, high-quality ingredients like rabbit, goose, and locally sourced vegetables, with vegan, allergen-free and gluten-free options always available. Through our app and website, students can easily order and pick up meals across campus, avoiding the unhealthy offerings of fast food without giving up the convenience. As a volunteer-driven program, we are powered by students, supported by nonprofit and government partners, and committed to giving back in the form of food donations and community volunteering. Plus, our rewards program lets you earn perks for spreading the word. Carrot Café is more than just eating healthily; it's our collective effort to create a more innovative, healthier food system.</p>
